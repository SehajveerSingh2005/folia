## Core Features

Folia is built around distinct "spaces" and powerful tools, each tailored for a specific purpose:

### **AI-Powered Planning**

Describe a goal, and our AI planner will generate a complete project in your Flow, broken down into actionable tasks with smart deadlines. It intelligently decides whether your goal needs a long-term plan, a single project, or just a few simple tasks.

### **Customizable Dashboard**

A widget-based homepage that gives you an at-a-glance view of your day. Arrange widgets like a clock, task inbox, quick notes, and goals overview to create the perfect command center.

### **Flow**

The space for your active projects, courses, and endeavors. Each item has its own notes and a dedicated task list, helping you track progress from start to finish.

### **Garden**

A creative space to cultivate raw ideas and quick notes. Let your thoughts grow, find connections, and "promote" a seed of an idea into a full-fledged project in your Flow when it's ready.

### **Journal**

A private space for daily reflection. Use the calendar to navigate through your entries, track your mood, and import completed tasks to get a clear picture of your progress.

### **Horizon**

Your personal space for long-term planning. Set your sights on future goals, track skills you want to learn, books you want to read, or maintain a simple wishlist.

### **Loom**

A unified command center for all your tasks. See everything you need to do from your inbox and across all your projects in one organized, filterable view.
